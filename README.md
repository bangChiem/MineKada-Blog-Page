# BKAD Minecraft Server Blog

This is a side project to help me learn full stack development, while also serving as a functioning blog page for the Minekada Minecraft server. The website allows users to write blogs, updates, events, and announcements related to the server.

## Features
- **FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT**: Utilizes both React, Node.js to handle server-side logic and dynamic page rendering.
- **USER AUTHENTICATION**: Uses firebase auth to authenticate users. Users can create accounts to write articles, comment on articles, and upvote articles.
- **RESPONSIVE DESIGN**: Web app can be used for both mobile and desktop users.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js), Bootstrap, React-bootstrap, reactjs-popup
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Firebase Auth, Axios
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing blog posts and other dynamic content)
