# BKAD Minecraft Server Blog

This is a side project to help me learn full stack development, while also serving as a functioning blog page for the Minekada Minecraft server. The website allows users to write blogs, updates, events, and announcements related to the server.

## Features
- **Full-Stack Development**: Utilizes both React, Node.js to handle server-side logic and dynamic page rendering.
- **Blog Posts**: Allows users to read and interact with posts related to the Minecraft server.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js), Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing blog posts and other dynamic content)
